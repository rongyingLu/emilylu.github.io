# \1. [**Identifying Gene Expression Patterns in Adult Drosophila melanogaster Testes using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data**](project1.md)

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the expression profiles of genes across nine distinct cell types (stages) within the Drosophila melanogaster testes. By analyzing scRNA-seq data, we can identify genes that are preferentially expressed or downregulated in specific cell types. This knowledge will provide a deeper understanding of testicular development and function in Drosophila.
