# 1. [**Identifying Gene Expression Patterns in Adult Drosophila melanogaster Testes using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data**](project1.md)

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the expression profiles of genes across nine distinct cell types (stages) within the Drosophila melanogaster testes. By analyzing scRNA-seq data, we can identify genes that are preferentially expressed or downregulated in specific cell types. This knowledge will provide a deeper understanding of testicular development and function in Drosophila.

# 2. [**Gene Expression Table Simulation and Analysis**](project2.md)

The primary goal of this project is to develop a versatile script capable of simulating gene expression tables from various types of CSV files and performing probabilistic analyses to assess the significance of observed gene counts. The script generates three crucial outputs: the simulation table, higher probabilities table, and lower probabilities table.
