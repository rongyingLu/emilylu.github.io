# 1. [**Identifying Gene Expression Patterns in Adult Drosophila melanogaster Testes using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _portfolio/project1.md %})

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the expression profiles of genes across nine distinct cell types (stages) within the Drosophila melanogaster testes. By analyzing scRNA-seq data, we can identify genes that are preferentially expressed or downregulated in specific cell types. This knowledge will provide a deeper understanding of testicular development and function in Drosophila.

# 2. [**Gene Expression Table Simulation and Analysis**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _portfolio/project2.md %})

The primary goal of this project is to develop a versatile script capable of simulating gene expression tables from various types of CSV files and performing probabilistic analyses to assess the significance of observed gene counts. The script generates three crucial outputs: the simulation table, higher probabilities table, and lower probabilities table.

# 3. [**De Novo Gene Assembly (On Going)**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _portfolio/project3.md %})

The main objective of this ongoing research project is to achieve highly contiguous genome assemblies for various Drosophila melanogaster species. The project aims to investigate the impact of combining PacBio and Illumina reads on assembly quality, with a specific focus on reducing genome fragmentation. By leveraging advanced assembly techniques and tools, we seek to generate more complete and accurate genome sequences for further analysis and interpretation.
