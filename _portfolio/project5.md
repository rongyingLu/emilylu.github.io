---
This project used a questionnaire to collect weekly Ecological Momentary Assessment (weeklyEMA) data from pregnant women. The primary objective was to monitor the sleep status during different pregnancy stages and examine the impact of negative emotions on sleep quality and cardiovascular health.

**Methodology:**

Data Collection: Pregnant women participants were provided with a weeklyEMA questionnaire to record their sleep patterns and emotional states throughout their pregnancy.

Sleep Monitoring: Sleep patterns were quantified using sleep tracking devices to measure sleep duration, stages (deep sleep and REM sleep), and interruptions.

Emotional Assessment: Participants reported their emotional states using the questionnaire, providing data on negative emotions experienced during the week.

Cardiovascular Health: Heart rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measurements were collected to assess cardiovascular health.

Data Analysis: Statistical analyses were performed to examine the relationship between negative emotions and sleep quality. The effects of negative emotions on deep sleep, REM sleep, HRV, and HR were quantified using appropriate statistical methods.

**Key Findings:**

Deep Sleep: An increase in negative emotions was associated with shorter periods of deep sleep.
Heart Rate Variability (HRV): An increase in negative emotions resulted in reduced HRV, indicating potential autonomic nervous system disturbances.
Heart Rate (HR): No conclusive relationship was found between negative emotions and heart rate, as the p-value was greater than 0.05.
REM Sleep: An increase in negative emotions was correlated with longer REM sleep durations.
Conclusion:
The study's results suggest that addressing negative emotions in pregnant women is crucial for improving sleep quality and overall well-being during pregnancy. By addressing negative emotions, potential improvements in sleep patterns and cardiovascular health can be achieved, benefiting both the mother and the developing fetus.

**Limitations:**
It is essential to acknowledge some limitations in the study, such as potential bias due to self-reported data and a small sample size. Further research with a larger and more diverse cohort could strengthen the study's conclusions.
