**Goals and Objectives:**
Long-term Goals:
To create a novel multimodal imaging system that combines electroacoustic tomography (EAT) and ultrasound (US) imaging for monitoring electroporation to kill tumors precisely.

Goals for the Proposed Project Period:
To determine how EAT/US can be used for more accurately monitoring electroporation of tumors on ex vivo biological samples.

**Introduction:**
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a nonthermal tissue ablation technique that causes cell death in tumor tissue while preserving the extracellular matrix and inducing minimal inflammation, making it a promising treatment for unresectable liver tumors. Real-time monitoring of the electroporation process is critical to ensure the tumor has been fully treated. EAT, a novel imaging technique, involves simultaneous acquisition of electroacoustic and ultrasound signals with the same probe, making it superior for this purpose. The significance of this research lies in developing non-invasive imaging techniques to accurately predict complete necrotic tissue (IRE zone) after IRE procedures and identify inadequately treated reversibly electroporated tumor tissues (RE zone) for effective clinical application.

**Methods:**
The research involves building the EAT system, which uses pulsed electric fields for in-situ monitoring. Acoustic signals generated due to thermal expansion are detected by an ultrasonic transducer. The signal analysis and image reconstruction are performed using MATLAB. Ex vivo tests on cells and chicken breast will be conducted as the ultimate goal is human tissue analysis.

**Electroacoustic Tomography (EAT) for Tumor Monitoring:**
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising nonthermal tissue ablation technique that selectively kills tumor cells while preserving surrounding tissues. However, collateral damage to adjacent parenchymal tissues and blood vessels remains a concern. EAT offers a novel solution as it can accurately predict the extent of centrally necrotic tissue (IRE zone) after IRE procedures, allowing for effective and targeted therapy.

**The Simultaneous Acquisition of Electroacoustic and Ultrasound Signals:**
In our research, we simultaneously acquire electroacoustic signals (EAs) and ultrasound signals using a single ultrasound probe. This allows us to monitor and analyze tissue temperature changes induced by different electric fields during electroporation. The real-time imaging capability of EAT, combined with ultrasound's linear scan structures, reduces artifacts and enhances accuracy.

**Experimental Setup and Signal Analysis:**
Our initial step is to build the EAT system, involving the implementation of electronic pulse generators, electrode needles, a water tank, an ultrasonic transducer, preamplifiers, oscilloscopes, and PCs. The electronic pulse generators are connected to positive and negative electrode needles attached to the sample, and the resulting signals are amplified and analyzed using MATLAB. Signal reconstruction is achieved through a back projection algorithm.

**Promising Preliminary Results:**
During the testing phase, we have successfully demonstrated the ability of EAT to capture acoustic signals in real-time by employing phantoms with different salt concentrations. Our results showcase the potential of EAT/US imaging as a powerful tool for precision cancer therapy.

**Future Directions:**
In the coming stages of our research, we will conduct ex vivo tests to move closer to human tissue scenarios. Additionally, we are open to exploring alternative analytical approaches and incorporating novel datasets to gain deeper insights into the efficacy and potential applications of this groundbreaking imaging system.

**Conclusion:**
The EAT/US imaging system offers a promising path towards achieving precise and targeted cancer treatment. Our research endeavors to enhance the understanding and application of this technology to ultimately contribute to the advancement of cancer therapy and improve patient outcomes.
