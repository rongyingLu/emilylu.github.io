## General Goal of the Project and Specific Hypothesis

The general goal of this project is to generate highly contiguous genome assemblies. The project utilizes raw sequencing data from different Drosophila melanogaster species, including paulistorum raw, paulistorum rawHap, willistoni guad raw, willistoni guad rawHap, willistoni urug raw, and willistoni urug rawHap reads. The specific hypothesis being tested is that combining PacBio and Illumina reads will result in less fragmented genome assemblies compared to assemblies using only one type of read.

## Methods Employed to Test the Hypothesis

To test the hypothesis, I performed genome assemblies using different combinations of reads and assessed various metrics, such as NR50. The assemblies combining both PacBio and Illumina reads were expected to be more contiguous, indicated by a higher N50 value. The following steps were taken to conduct the assembly and evaluation process:

1. **De Novo Assembly with Flye:** Flye, a de novo assembler for single-molecule sequencing reads, was used for the initial assembly using long-read data from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
2. **Polishing with Racon:** Racon, a standalone consensus module, was utilized to correct raw contigs generated by rapid assembly methods. The initial assembly obtained from Flye was subjected to long-read polishing using racon for two rounds.
3. **Polishing with Medaka:** Medaka was used for further polishing of the assemblies. One round of polishing with Medaka was performed.
4. **Gene Completeness Assessment with BUSCO:** The completeness of the gene sets in the assemblies was evaluated using BUSCO. If the duplicated BUSCOs exceeded 1% in the assembly, the duplicated sequences were removed. If the duplicated BUSCOs were less than 1%, short-read polishing using pilon was conducted, followed by a re-evaluation of the completeness using BUSCO.

## Results of the Research

At the current stage of the project, I have completed the Flye and racon assemblies and performed BUSCO analysis on them. The Flye assembly showed larger contigs compared to the racon assembly. However, the expected N50 values were not achieved for most of the reads, suggesting that some of the reads may not have been successfully assembled. As a result, a second Flye analysis was initiated, with subread lengths of 10,000 and 5,000 as the threshold. The researchers hope that this will lead to improved N50 values.

Regarding the BUSCO results, the Flye assembly outperformed the racon assembly, with BUSCO completeness scores above 99%, while the racon assembly scored around 97%. The insecta_odb10 lineage was used for this analysis, and the next step involves using the diptera_odb10 lineage for further evaluation.
