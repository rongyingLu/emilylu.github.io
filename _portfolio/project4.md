---

The primary objective of this research project is to investigate the expression of transposable elements (TEs) in Drosophila, with focus on Drosophila melanogaster. We first did the male_testis_adult samples. TEs are mobile genetic elements that can move within a genome, and their expression can have significant implications for genome stability and regulation. To accomplish our goal, we are employing the scTE method, as described in the paper "scTE: A computational framework to profile transposable element expression at single-cell resolution" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21808-x).

The workflow for this project involves several critical steps:

1. Data Acquisition: We have obtained the necessary male_testis_adult samples and corresponding fastq files for single-cell RNA sequencing.
2. Alignment: The fastq files will be aligned to the Drosophila reference genome to map the reads to their genomic positions.
3. Data Cleaning: After alignment, we will perform data cleaning and filtering to ensure the quality and reliability of the data.
4. TE Expression Profiling: The cleaned and processed data will be input into the scTE computational framework. scTE is specifically designed to profile TE expression at single-cell resolution, providing valuable insights into TE activity within individual cells.
5. Output Analysis: Once the TE expression profiles are obtained from scTE, we will analyze the results to identify patterns of TE expression across different cell types and conditions.

The project's outcomes are expected to shed light on the dynamic regulation of TEs in Drosophila male_testis_adult samples. By using the scTE method, we aim to reveal the heterogeneous expression of TEs at the single-cell level, which could have implications for understanding TE biology, genome evolution, and potential regulatory roles of TEs in Drosophila development.

Furthermore, the data generated from this study will serve as a valuable resource for further analyses, such as identifying TE-regulated genes and potential interactions between TEs and other genomic elements. Ultimately, this research will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of TEs on the Drosophila genome and provide insights into the broader role of TEs in genome function and evolution.
